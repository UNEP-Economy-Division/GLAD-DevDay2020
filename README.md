# GLAD-DevDays2020
When developers, life cycle practitioners and everyone interested in life cycle analysis decide to work together for some days to improve access and use of global life cycle data for a more sustainable planet

This space was created to collectively plan and organise the GLAD DevDays sometime in 2020.
